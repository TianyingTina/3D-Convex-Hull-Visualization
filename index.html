            <h5 class="w3-center">From Wikipedia</h5>
            <p class="w3-large">In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it. The convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset of a Euclidean space, or equivalently as the set of all convex combinations of points in the subset. For a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the subset.

                  </p>
            <p class="w3-large">Convex hulls of open sets are open, and convex hulls of compact sets are compact. Every compact convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points. The convex hull operator is an example of a closure operator, and every antimatroid can be represented by applying this closure operator to finite sets of points. The algorithmic problems of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane or other low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and its dual problem of intersecting half-spaces, are fundamental problems of computational geometry. They can be solved in time O(nlog n) for two or three dimensional point sets.

            <p class="w3-text-grey"> Construct the initial tetrahedron: The initial tetrahedron consists of four points.
                These four points are required that any three points are not collinear, and the four points are not
                coplanar. Otherwise,
                the initial tetrahedron cannot be generated, which will cause problems in the following incremental
                construction of the convex hull.
                If there are no such four points exist in the point set, the convex hull cannot be constructed and
                returns Null.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey"> Add each vertex incrementally:
                Find all the faces that are visible to the vertex.
                The visibility of the face can be determined by the normal direction of the face.
                First calculate the normal direction N of the face, and then calculate the dot product of N and the
                vector that any point in this face to the new added point.
                If the product is greater than zero, then the point and the face are visible to each other, that is, the
                face needs to be
                removed. In the actual algorithm, this step should be completed by sequentially calculating the
                visibility of all the faces with the current point, but
                the efficiency may be very low.</p>

                can find
                all visible faces through the connection relationship between the faces.</p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">Based on the Advanced Incremental Construction Algorithm, for the first three points
                which construct a face that
                dividing the points in two halves P1 and P2. First find 2 points which has the longest distance, connect
                them.
                Second find the point that has the longest distance with the connected edge. These three points consist
                first triangle/face of the initial tetrahedron.
                Then recursively find CH(P1) and CH(P2) then merge them. How I merge here is just remove the original
                initial triangle. Here I use the same dfs as the advanced incremental construction.</p>

            <h4><a href='html/gift_wrapping_animation.html'>Gift Wrapping</a></h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Find the first face on the convex hull:
                The first face is not a randomly picked face, it is necessary to ensure that this surface is a surface
                on the convex hull. First, the point with the smallest y coordinate
                must be a point on the convex hull, and this point is on the the first face on the convex hull.
                The second point is the point with the smallest angle between the connection line with it and the first
                point and the xz plane.
                Now consider the tangent plane of the conical surface passing through the first point and the second
                point.
                The third point is the point that forms the smallest angle that the triangle/face of it and the previous
                two points with the tangent plane with the previous two points.
                Obviously, the above three points is a surface on the convex hull.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">gift "Wrapped":
                The wrapping starts from any currently unclosed triangle edge. Select any of its unclosed edges,
                and use that edge as a basis. Select a point from the remaining vertices so that the new face formed by the unclosed edge
                and the vertex is the same as the previously dependent face
                The film angle is the smallest. Obviously, the face piece selected in this way is also the face on the
                convex hull.</p>
